    <section>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine the yeast, sugar, and warm milk and stir until the yeast and sugar are fully dissolved</li>
        <li>In the mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients starting with the flour then the sugar, salt, and baking powder . Mix well by stirring
        </li>
        <li>Add the egg, butter, cooking oil, and yeast-sugar-milk mixture in the mixing bowl with the dry ingredients then mix again until a dough is formed. Use your clean hands to effectively mix the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>In a flat surface, knead the dough until the texture becomes fine. For faster and easier kneading, you may use a Stand Mixer with dough hook.
        </li>
        <li>Mold the dough until shape becomes round then put back in the mixing bowl. Cover the mixing bowl with damp cloth and let the dough rise for at least 1 hour</li>
        <li>Put the dough back to the flat surface and divide into 4 equal parts using a dough slicer</li>
        <li>Roll each part until it forms a cylindrical shape</li>
        <li>Slice the cylindrical dough diagonally (These slices will be the individual pieces of the pandesal)</li>
        <li>Roll the sliced dough over the breadcrumbs and place in a baking tray with wax paper (makes sure to provide gaps between dough as this will rise later on)</li>
        <li>Leave the sliced dough with breadcrumbs in the tray for another 10 to 15 minutes to rise</li>
        <li>Pre-heat the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes
        </li>
        <li>Put the tray with dough in the oven and bake for 15 minutes
        </li>
        <li>Turn off the oven and remove the freshly baked pandesal.</li>
        <li>Serve hot. Share and enjoy!</li>
